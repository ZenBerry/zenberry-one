          I tried many different approaches and decided that plain old html is the best one. Love you guys with old devices!

          For some years, I'm building an open-source platform that will allow people to post without immediate feedback. It's not ready yet, but you can try the prototype and take part in development. It will also help creative people to organise themselves.

          Recovering after a bad phase, I said to myself: OK, Eugene, as you have some energy now, do anything you want but don't watch YouTube. So I decided to write this post.

          I'm in a mental hospital. But there's a good game of table tennis here. And the internet is also better. Which means ping is better here as well. I don't know why people have to apologize for their puns. Probably English is just punnier than other languages.

          I saw a dream where the whole world was a bath and the moon was the hole to where the excess water flowed. Sometimes I need this kind of thing in my head as well.

          I've heard from other people that my crush understood that she was my crush. What a shame.

          10 years ago I couldn't imagine how much hatred I could host. Mostly, it's the hatred towards myself and the physical world. I mean, look at this piece of shit. Who even created it

          THAT'S how often I've been posting without having any feedback, back in 2007! Or was it just coffee?
          Or is it because I just blocked my crush in all messengers like I did back then (with another crush?)
          It never does anything good except you start emitting nonsense, probably hoping to reach her somehow anyways, presumably by making your friends to gossip that you went nuts

          However, I always have to remind myself of a following principle: when I decide
          to be a bad guy, everything becomes bad as well.
          Bad as hell.

          Another benefit of a plain html blog is that it won't freaking disappear.
          Also, now I don't have to ask 'what do you think about ... ?'
          Cause I honestly don't care. All we need is istant gratification, which is absent here.
          So you can't blame me in the comments.
          What do you think about it, huh?

          It's so soothing without all those likes.
          I mean, it doesn't matter whether you have zero or a million.
          You still feel bad when there's a number.
          It is somewhat similar to money.
          You don't have any number in mind at all when you're a child. And you're so much happier.

          I swear it feels like 2010. I was 17...
          Just went to a 24/7 grocery store and grabbed a Kinder Bueno thing.
          After 4 years of no-chocolate bullshit.
          Where are you, my first love, where are you, my darling.
          It's sad that I'm 31. Being 31 is like you're a teenage loser.
          You're still losing your mind, but you're losing your hair as well.

          Hello there. After four good years of living like a robot, I broke all my rules and had a coffee.
          Now I found myself in the middle of Limassol, Cyprus, sitting alone in a hostel, coding in the middle of the night. Well.
